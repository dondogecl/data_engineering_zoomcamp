# Data Engineering Zoomcamp notes

The purpose of this repository is to store the notes, lessons learned, and exercises completed to finish the **Data Engineering Zoomcamp** ( you can learn more at https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/) on my own pace.   

I intend to provide my take on the tasks and tools used, and document the processes as well. 

There is a capstone project at the end of the course, which will liekly be developed in another branch of this repository and be saved to its own folder.
